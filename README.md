# Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival 

I redesigned the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival's website for my third project INFO 1300 Introduction to Web Design and Programming project.

About the Client: Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival is one of the biggest community event that brings people residing in Ithaca together every year. The website can be hard to navigate because all the content are on one page, so one of the main goals is easy navigation.

Audience Goals: The website aims to cater to people who are in or near Ithaca (either people who live in or near Ithaca locally, or students attending schools in Ithaca). It is a cohesive group because they all want to do something fun and enjoy their lives in Ithaca, where there are rarely any fun events to do. Thus, they will be the ones who will be the most interested in attending the festival and likely seeking out information about it.

My Design and Interactivity Choices: white minimalistic theme, text over full screen image layout, accordion, hamburger menu

Below are the files needed other than the web files to access our project.
